Great! Based on the contents of the OpenCV Python samples directory, here are the most relevant demos you can showcase for robotics applications:

ðŸ¤– Recommended OpenCV Python Demos for Robotics
1. facedetect.py
Use case: Human-robot interaction.
Why: Detects faces in real-time using Haar cascades.
++2. camshift.py
Use case: Object tracking.
Why: Demonstrates adaptive tracking of colored objectsâ€”useful for following targets.
3. kalman.py
Use case: Sensor fusion and prediction.
Why: Shows how to use Kalman filters for tracking and predictionâ€”critical in robotics.
++ 4. lk_track.py
Use case: Visual odometry.
Why: Tracks motion between frames using optical flowâ€”useful for navigation.
+ 5. plane_tracker.py
Use case: Augmented reality or surface tracking.
Why: Tracks planar surfacesâ€”can be used for robot localization or AR overlays.
6. aruco_detect_board_charuco.py
Use case: Localization and mapping.
Why: Detects ArUco markers and ChArUco boardsâ€”used in robot positioning and calibration.
7. stereo_match.py
Use case: Depth estimation.
Why: Computes disparity maps from stereo imagesâ€”important for obstacle avoidance.
8. opt_flow.py / dis_opt_flow.py
Use case: Motion detection.
Why: Demonstrates dense optical flowâ€”can be used for terrain following or motion analysis.
9. peopledetect.py
Use case: Human detection.
Why: Uses HOG + SVM to detect peopleâ€”useful for safety and interaction.
10. qrcode.py
Use case: Object identification or navigation.
Why: Detects and decodes QR codesâ€”used in logistics and robot guidance.

Would you like help running any of these demos or combining them into a robotics showcase project?
