i need a python code that uses open cv that would open a window of my camera feed and would be able to detect different coloured objects from what it sees, it has to be as accurate as possible, so that the camera could recognize the distinct form of the object it sees. The code has to have a contrast slider UI feature next to the camera feed and display a 1d histogram, for maximum efficiency the program has to be written to work under most lighting conditions and still be able to detect the objects even if the lighting isn't perfect, the best way i thought of achieving this would be to group the main different colours along with their saturations into one group so that if shading is a bit different in different parts of the same object it would still pick up the full dimensions. I'll provide an example that has the correct pop-up window of the camera feed, correct histogram and a flawed version of colour detection written:



labas as noriu kad sukurtum programa python kalba kuri rodyt≈≥ kameros vaizda naudojant opencv kad rodytu vaizda per visa ekrana



I want to make my robot got to each point then notify the camera thread to store the colour data (color = f"Color: {closest_color}" ) into a 3x3 array and print the resulting data of the array to the log 
after the for loop finishers in the robot_movement_thread find the best solution to this problem an generate full code:
